## Updated Widget Controller for Experience Builder Developer version 1.13

**Note: the following steps are meant for version 1.13**

1. First, navigate to the following website: [Experience Builder Developer Download](https://developers.arcgis.com/experience-builder/guide/downloads/)
2. Download version 1.14
   * It is unnecessary to extract the whole folder, unless you cannot open the folder without extracting it
3. If it possible, open the folder `ArcGISExperienceBuilder`, without extracting it, and follow this path: `client/dist/widgets/common`.
   * If you must extract the folder first, ensure the extracted folder won't cause any conflict with your any other Experience Builder Developer folders
4. Find and extract this folder: `controller`
5. Find the folder you just extracted, copy or cut it, and go to your Experience Builder Developer version 1.13 folder
6. Follow this path: `client/dist/widgets/common`
7. There should be already a folder called `controller`. Rename it to something else that won't cause any conflict with other folders
8. Paste the 1.14 version `controller` folder you cut or copied earlier
9. This should update Widget Controller from 1.13 to 1.14

## Why?

In version 1.14, widget controller has been updated, which means all widget under the Layout section can now be added to the widget controller. 
For any versions below 1.14, this is one quick way to support the same functionality.
